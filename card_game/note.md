1. ##### Code

    ```go
    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
        var card string = "Ace of Spades"
        fmt.Println(card)
    }
    ```

2. ##### Syntax

    ```go
    var card string = "Ace of Spades"
    ```

    1. `string`: basic data type
    2. `bool`: true or false
    3. `int`: numbers 0, -1000, 9999
    4. `float64`: 10.00001, 0.0009, -100.003
    5. need to give data type to variable

    ```go
    card := "Ace of Spades"
    ```

    the code above, would do the same job as the previous syntax. Go will interfer data type based on the right-hand value.

    Don't have to change use `:=` if we just want to re-assign a variable. Otherwise, if we need initilize vairable, then we can use it.

3. ##### Functions

    ```go
    func newCard() string {
    	return "Five of Diamonds"
    }
    ```

    1. `string` is the return type of the function. We need to declare it expiclitly in Golang
    2. `newCard` starts from lower case, which means it's a private function
    3. `return` end execution and return the value of computation

4. ##### Slice and Array

    Array: fixed length list of things

    Slice: an array that can grow and shrink

    1. need to have same type

    2. ```go
        var cards []string = []string {"Ace of Diamonds", "Ace of Spades"}
        cards = append(cards, "Six of Spades")
        ```

        append will not change the slice, instead, it will return a new slice

    3. How to iterator slice

        ```go
        for index, card := range cards {
            fmt.Println(index, card)
        }
        ```

        `index`: the index of the element that current iterating

        `card`: the content of the element

        `range`: `i` and `card` are initialized everytime it starts iterating, the previous one will be  dropped after iteration.

5. `type` Syntax

    1. ```go
        type deck []string
        ```

        This is kind like alias, by using type to declare a deck, basically will associate all function from `[]string` to `deck` therefore `deck` become a new data type that we can use within the package.

        > For some unknown reason, VS Code is give error when using deck,  but it runnable.

    2. Why we need this type: we can add more addtional function associated with this type specifically. So we can add some customised function with existing type

        ```go
        func (d deck) print() {
            for i, card := range d {
                fmt.Println(i, card)
            }
        }
        ```

        `(d deck)` means this is a receiver,  which means, cross all the variable whose type is deck will have the access to this function.  To call it, use `cards.print()`
